# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the 1Password load-secrets-action project ðŸ‘‹! Before you start, please take a moment to read through this guide to understand our contribution process.

## Testing

Unit tests can be run with `npm run test`.

After following the steps below for signing commits, you can test against your PR with these steps:

1. Create or use an existing repo to run the `load-secrets` GitHub Action.
2. In a workflow yaml file that uses the GitHub Action, modify the `uses: 1Password/load-secrets-action` line to be

   ```yaml
   uses: 1Password/load-secrets-action@<branch-name>
   ```

   OR

   ```yaml
   uses: 1Password/load-secrets-action@<commit-hash>
   ```

3. Trigger the action, which now includes your changes.

## Documentation Updates

If applicable, update the [README.md](./README.md) to reflect any changes introduced by the new code.
