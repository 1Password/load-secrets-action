`load-secrets-action` loads secrets from 1Password into GitHub Actions using [Service Accounts](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts) or [1Password Connect](https://developer.1password.com/docs/connect).

Specify in your workflow YAML file which secrets from 1Password should be loaded into your job, and the action will make them available as environment variables for the next steps.

        env:
          OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN }}
          SECRET: op://app-cicd/hello-world/secret

      - name: Print masked secret
        run: 'echo "Secret: ${{ steps.load_secrets.outputs.SECRET }}"'
