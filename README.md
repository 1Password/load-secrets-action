`load-secrets-action` loads secrets from 1Password into GitHub Actions using [Service Accounts](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts) or [1Password Connect](https://developer.1password.com/docs/connect).

Specify in your workflow YAML file which secrets from 1Password should be loaded into your job, and the action will make them available as environment variables for the next steps.
